# The-Encryption-Debate


The repository contains a collection of Tweet IDs associated with the spring 2016 debate over the FBI’s request that Apple decrypt a user’s iPhone. In this “encryption debate,”
public opinion was polarized between advocates for individual privacy and advocates for national security. 

This dataset contains tweets collected from January 1, 2016 through March 31, 2016. The data was collected using Crimson Hexagon, a social media analytics platform that provides paid firehose access. To comply with Twitter’s [Terms of Service](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy), we are only publicly releasing the Tweet IDs of the collected Tweets. The data is released for non-commercial research use. The total number of annotated tweets is 3000 tweets.
